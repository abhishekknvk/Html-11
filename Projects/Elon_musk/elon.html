      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section id="introduction">
        <!-- Your content here -->
        Elon Musk, a name synonymous with cutting-edge technology and audacious
        entrepreneurial spirit, has been at the forefront of revolutionizing
        several industries. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971, Musk has
        been instrumental in the development of online payments, electric
        vehicles, and space travel. His ventures, including PayPal, Tesla, and
        SpaceX, have not only disrupted traditional sectors but also paved the
        way for a sustainable and interplanetary future.

        <!-- Your content here -->
        Tesla Inc., co-founded by Elon Musk, is an American electric vehicle and
        clean energy company. It is at the vanguard of the electric vehicle
        revolution, consistently pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with
        electric powertrains. Tesla’s mission is to “accelerate the advent of
        sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars
        to market as soon as possible.” The company’s electric vehicles,
        including the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, have gained
        significant popularity worldwide, thanks to their impressive range,
        performance, and safety features. Tesla’s Gigafactories, spread across
        different continents, aim to streamline the production process and
        further the company’s mission of a sustainable energy future.

      <section id="spacex">
        <!-- Your content here -->
        Space Exploration Technologies Corp., better known as SpaceX, is another
        brainchild of Elon Musk. Founded in 2002, SpaceX’s mission is “to
        revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of making life
        multiplanetary.” SpaceX has made significant strides in reducing the
        cost of space travel by developing reusable rockets, a concept that was
        considered science fiction before. Its Falcon and Starship rockets have
        already delivered numerous satellites into space, resupplied the
        International Space Station (ISS), and even carried astronauts to the
        ISS and back. SpaceX’s ambitious projects, such as Starlink (a
        constellation of satellites providing internet connectivity) and the
        planned missions to Mars, underscore its pivotal role in shaping the
        future of space exploration.
